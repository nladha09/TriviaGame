# TriviaGame

Trivia game made with jQuery and Bootstrap that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. (20 seconds)

If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulates them for choosing the right option.

After a few seconds, the next question will display without user input; the scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, the player is notified that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is notified that they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed. 

After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game is diplayed (without reloading the page).
